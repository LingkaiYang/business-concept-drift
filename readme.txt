This repository includes three types of concept drifts data:

  1. Gradual changes in control-flow. A synthetic dataset of 18 event logs containing different types of gradual process drift.
  2. Sudden changes in customer behaviour. One event log.
  3. Gradual changes in customer behaviour. One event log.

All those data are artificially created based on the Abderrahmane Maaradji's datasets referring to a Loan Assessment process [1].
The original data can be downloaded from https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Business_Process_Drift/12712436
The original data only includes sudden drifts in control-flow, and thereafter, we extended those data as another three types as abovementioned.
